# Privatisator

Firefox plugin to open the currently shown page in a private tab: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privatisator/ .

Gone are the days of Ctrl+L Ctrl+C Ctrl+Shift+P Ctrl+L (this one wasnt necessary, but ... muscle memory ðŸ¦¾) Ctrl+V .

Especially handy for web dev when you need to see how the current page looks without login/without certain cookies.

Should also work in chromium.
