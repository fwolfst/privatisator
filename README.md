# Privatisator

Firefox plugin to open the currently shown page in a private tab: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privatisator/ .

Gone are the days of Ctrl+L Ctrl+C Ctrl+Shift+P Ctrl+L (this one wasnt necessary, but ... muscle memory ðŸ¦¾) Ctrl+V .

Especially handy for web dev when you need to see how the current page looks without login/without certain cookies.

Should also work in chromium.

## Release

```bash
# Bump version in manifest.json, e.g. for minor version
ruby -i -pe '$_.gsub!(/(?<=version": ")(\d.\d)/) {|m| "#{m.to_f + 0.1}"}' manifest.json

# Memorize version
VERSION=$(grep "\"version" manifest.json  | grep -o "[0-9].[0-9]")

# Commit and tag
git add .
git commit -m "v$VERSION"
git tag  -a "v$VERSION"
git push -a

# Zip it up
zip -r -FS ../privatisator.zip * --exclude '*.git*`
```

Then upload to MOA.
